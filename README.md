# CS-673-Midterm-Project
Load the dataset from the Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame.

● Clean and preprocess the data (as outlined below).

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

● Check and correct data types.

● Handle missing or NULL values, drop unwanted columns, and remove duplicates.

● Apply filtering and slicing on specific columns or rows.

Data Visualization:

● Identify outliers with box plots or histograms.

● Create pair plots to explore relationships between features.

● Use heatmaps to show correlations.

● Scatter plots for relationship analysis between two variables.

Data Storage in SQL:

● Connect to a SQL database (using a library like SQLAlchemy or MySQL).

● Create a table and insert your cleaned and processed data from Python into the SQL database.

● Use SQL INSERT, UPDATE, or CREATE TABLE statements as needed.

Data Analysis: ● Perform statistical or mathematical operations using Python libraries.

● Write SQL queries to further analyze the data stored in the database.

Libraries: Make sure to use at least four libraries (e.g., Pandas, SQLAlchemy, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
